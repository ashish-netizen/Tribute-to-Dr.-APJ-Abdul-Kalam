            <h2>Remembering the Legend Of India</h2>

            <p>
                On his fifth passing commemoration today, Etawah Diaries recalled Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, prevalently known
                as the Missile Man of India. He was an extraordinary compassionate and a visionary who filled in as the
                eleventh President of India from 2002 to 2007, showed understudies and accomplished achievements as a
                researcher. Dr Kalam died on July 27, 2015, while conveying a talk to understudies at the Indian
                Institute of Management, Shillong. In any case, he is still affectionately recalled by the residents of
                India as a wellspring of motivation.

                In his words, "<b>You have to dream before your dreams can come true.</b>"</p>

            <p>
                Abdul Kalam will remain one of the finest human beings to have ever lived. He lived an illustrious and
                successful life, and his legacy will continue to inspire people around the world in the coming years.
                Below is a list that tries to do justice to his numerous achievements:


            </p>
            <div>
                <ol>
                    <li>After graduating from Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Mr Kalam joined the Defense
                        Research and Development Organization (DRDO). He designed helicopters for the Indian Army, but
                        he always said he didn’t feel at home at the DRDO.

                    </li>

                    <li>
                        In 1969 he got the Government’s approval to expand the programme by including more engineers and
                        scientists.


                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After he was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), Mr Kalam worked as
                        the project director for SLV-III, India’s first indigenous satellite launch vehicle.

                    </li>



                    <li>SLV-III successfully launched satellite Rohini to orbit on July 1980. From then, Mr Kalam
                        expanded India’s space programme.

                    </li>
                    <li>In the 1980s he led India’s missile programme. Under his leadership, India became a major
                        military power after the successes of Agni and Prithvi.

                    </li>

                    <li> He was the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of Defence Research
                        and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999.</li>
                    <li>In 1998, along with cardiologist Dr.Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost Coronary stent. It was
                        named as “Kalam-Raju Stent” honouring them. In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet PC for
                        health care in rural areas, which was named as “Kalam-Raju Tablet”.
                    </li>

                    <li>In 1998, the Pokhran-II tests cemented India’s nuclear prowess. Mr Kalam played the pivotal role
                        in the project. He firmly told the international community that such arms were only to deter
                        other nations from trying to subjugate India, and were only to be used as “weapons of peace”. •


                    </li>

                    <li>In a rare show of unity, all political parties unanimously voted for Mr Kalam in 2002 as the
                        11th President of India.

                    </li>

                    <li>As President, Mr Kalam personified dignity and optimism throughout India and abroad. His
                        stirring speeches at the UN and the European Parliament are among the best ever delivered. His
                        simplicity in oration and action were applauded and made him dear to all.

                    </li>

                    <li>After the completion of his term as President, Mr Kalam became a visiting professor, wrote
                        extensively and launched many initiatives for youth development. “Wings of Fire” and “India
                        2020” are modern classics, and have motivated millions of Indians.

                    </li>

                    <li>His books envision his dream of India as a superpower, with Indians as innovative and unique in
                        their thinking. His speeches, books, works – all are the legacy of a man who spent all his life
                        trying to make the world a better place.
